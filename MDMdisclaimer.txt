Note: While this document references the requirement for iOS and Android device enrollment in Microsoft Intune, it does not provide detailed coverage of Mobile Application Management (MAM) policies, app protection policies, or comprehensive device restriction configurations applied to mobile devices. These mobile-specific security controls, including data loss prevention within corporate applications, app-level encryption, conditional access policies, and granular device restrictions, represent additional layers of protection for corporate data accessed through mobile applications on enrolled iOS and Android devices, but fall outside the scope of this Windows 365 BYOD assessment.
