Note: This documentation focuses specifically on data protection controls for BYOD device access to Windows 365 Cloud PCs. It does not encompass the comprehensive security configurations, policies, and controls applied to the Windows 365 Cloud PC hosts themselves, including but not limited to endpoint protection, system hardening, patch management, application controls, network segmentation, and other enterprise security measures implemented within the Cloud PC environment. These additional host-level security controls provide further layers of protection beyond the scope of this BYOD-focused assessment.
